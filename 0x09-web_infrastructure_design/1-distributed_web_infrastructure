Additional server: Serves as a backup for the other server incase of a crash.

Load Balancer (HAProxy): HAProxy help distributes the incoming traffic/requests across multiple server thus improving the website performance.
                         HAProxy is configured with a Round Robin distribution algorithm. It circles through the servers in a circular order ensuring load distribution.

The load balancer employs and active-active setup where all servers are actively serving requests.
In Active-Active setup, all servers are handling requests simultaneously but in a Passive-Active setup, the standby serves only become active when the main server crashes.

ISSUES WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE
Single Point of Failure: The primary database is a SPOF for write operations because when it fails, write operations halt.

Security Issues (No firewall, No https): An absence of firewall could lead to unauthorized access while lack of HTTPS leaves transmited data unecrypted and vulnerable to interception.

Monitoring: With no monitoring setup in place, the administators have no insight into the server performance, security threat, and other potential issues.
